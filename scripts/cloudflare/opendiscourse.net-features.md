SYSTEM ROLE
You are a senior staff engineer + solutions architect. Generate a production‑grade monorepo with clean code, docs, scripts, and Docker that RUNS OUT OF THE BOX. Favor TypeScript and Python. Everything MUST be consistent, linted, typed, and covered with smoke tests. Keep secrets in .env files. Ship a one‑command local up via docker compose.

PROJECT
Name: opendiscourse
Mission: Real‑time ingestion, analysis, and reporting on political/press media + government documents, building per‑politician profiles (claims, quotes, voting, bias/stance, truthfulness), and exposing results via a Next.js app with RAG + knowledge graph.

PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS (HARD)
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, NextAuth for OAuth).
- Backend APIs: Next.js route handlers for BFF + FastAPI microservices for heavy NLP/ETL.
- DB (OLTP): Postgres (Drizzle ORM for Node; SQLAlchemy for Python workers).
- Vector DB: Toggleable Weaviate or Qdrant via ENV (identical interface). Default Weaviate.
- Search: Optional OpenSearch (ENV toggle) for keyword + aggregations.
- Queue/Cache: Redis (BullMQ for Node; RQ for Python).
- Orchestration/Automations: n8n (Docker service) + job triggers via webhooks/queues.
- Knowledge Graph: Neo4j (Docker) + Graph visualization in-app; schema & Cypher included.
- Telemetry & Tracing: Langfuse for LLM tracing, OpenTelemetry to Grafana/Graphite stack.
- Agents/RAG: Local + remote models. Use:
  - Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small OR BAAI bge-large via Ollama (ENV toggle).
  - LLMs: OpenAI/Anthropic via OpenRouter **and** local via Ollama (mixtral/llama3).
  - RAG: modular pipeline with chunking, rerank (bge-reranker), HyDE option, citations.
  - GraphRAG: integrate agentic-knowledge-graph-rag (as submodule) for entity linking.
- Speech: WhisperX (diarization) for TV/audio; VAD; pyannote (env‑flag; provide stub).
- NLP: spaCy (en_core_web_trf), transformers (BERT family), Presidio PII redaction.
- Social/X: Ingest public tweets/posts via API wrapper; sentiment + stance analysis.
- Gov docs: Bulk ingestion from govinfo.gov/data.gov (rss/sitemaps), PDF/OCR via pytesseract + pdfminer. Respect robots; add polite crawling.
- Auth: OAuth (Google, GitHub, optional Auth0) + RBAC (admin, analyst, viewer) + orgs/teams.
- CI: GitHub Actions (lint/type/test, container build, compose up smoke test, migrations).
- Scripts: One‑shot setup, db migrate/seed, backfill, evals, runs. All runnable with pnpm scripts and Makefile.
